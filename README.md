## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install Go on your macOS system:

1. **Download the Go Installer:**

   Visit the official Golang website to download the installer for macOS. Go to [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/) and find the macOS version.
